  <h2>1. Shin & Somin</h2>
  <h3>The SS couple</h3>
  <p><strong><a href="http://www.nongshim.com/main/index" target="_blank" title="Shin Ramyun">Shin</a></strong> and <strong>Somin</strong> were couples since May 2019. Relatively speaking, their relationship has not been smooth. After a month into the relationship, they were separated as Shin graduated from Cambridge and went to Chicago for his masters. However, this was only the beginning. After meeting each other for the last time in January 2020, they were not able to reunite ever since due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Let's hope that these two could get reunited soon.</p>
