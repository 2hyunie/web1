  <h2>1. Shin & Somin</h2>
  <h3>How they met</h3>
  <p>It was a coincidence when <strong>Somin</strong> came across a <strong>young gentleman named <a href="http://www.nongshim.com/main/index" target="_blank" title="Shin Ramyun">Shin</a></strong> when she was just passing by to collect her card from Alice.</p><p>For the following two months, Shin invited Somin over to his college to study, and Somin gladly accepted. It was again with the help from Alice that triggered the two to become a couple.</p>
